BREAK OUT for the terminal (also in ssh or telnet)
==================================================

This is an ad-hoc implementation of the famous breakout game for the *NIX terminal. I wrote it so it would work also on z/OS USS specifically.

z/OS USS sports subtle differences from other, 'normal' *NIXES that make terminal stuff more challenging. This works on z/OS USS. 

To compile the program, make sure you have a c compiler, libncurses and libncurses-dev installed. Then just type **make**.   

I also have a version in Go, but installing Go on z/OS USS is itself still quite a task. 

Have fun!
