BREAK OUT for the terminal (also in ssh or telnet)
==================================================

This is an ad-hoc implementation of the famous breakout game for the *NIX terminal, in 350 lines or so.  I wrote it so it would work also on z/OS USS. but it runs on every type of *NIX, such as Linux, AIX, Macos, NetBSD, FreeBSD, Solaris, HP-UX, and Android. 

z/OS USS sports subtle differences from other, 'normal' *NIXES that make terminal stuff more challenging. This works on z/OS USS. 

To compile the program, make sure you have a c compiler, libncurses and libncurses-dev installed. Then just type **make**. It should compile without warnings, or errors, Gd forbid. 

Have fun!
