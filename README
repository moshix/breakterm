BREAK OUT for the USS terminal
==============================

This is an ad-hoc implementation of the famous breakout game for the *NIX terminal. I wrote it so it would work also on z/OS USS specifically.  

To compile the program, make sure you have libncurses and libncurses-dev installed. Then just type **make**. 

Have fun
